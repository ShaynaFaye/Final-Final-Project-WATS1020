          <h2>Preparing for Camp</h2>
          <p>First of all, prepare to have the summer of your life!</p>    
          <p>Since Camp Orkiss is located on Orcas Island, you must drive to Anacortes and then drive on or walk onto the ferry that will bring you to Orcas Island.  Do not worry if you walk on, a camp bus will be on the other side to pick you.</p>
          <p>What you should plan to bring to spend a summer at camp and in the outdoors:</p>
            <ul class="what-to-bring">
            <li>Clothes appropriate to work outdoors in both rain and shine. Including warm clothing as it gets chilly in the evenings.  Sandals or flip-flops are okay most of time, but must have closed-toe shoes to ride horses and participate on challenge courses.</li>
            <li>Your own toiletries, including sunscreen! Bathrooms are very basic, no blow-dryers or anything provided.</li>
            <li>Bedding: sleeping bag and pillow and sheet if you want one on your mattress pad.</li>
