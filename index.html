          <h2>About the Camp</h2>
          <p>Camp Orkiss was established in 1900 by the Orkiss family.  They were a wealthy familiy from Seattle who travelled to Orcas Island on holiday because they thought it sounded like their last name and fell in love with the luscious island and never left.  There were a lot of children in the Orkiss family who were very active, but there were not a lot of other kids their age on the island to play with so the Orkiss family created a camp to invite other children to come visit on their large property during the summers.  The Orkiss family eventually donated their property to become a full time camp for kids of all ages.</p>
          <p>Over the last 100 years or so, the camp has grown immensely.  Now about 400 campers visit camp each week as the summer is broken up into week long sessions.  About 200 staff work at camp as counselors, supervisors, extreme team members and support staff.  Everyone lives in open-air cabins, meaning there are no doors to close the outdoors out, just open doorways, so you always feel like you're outside.  The cabins also do not have electricity, there is no television or cell phones allowed at camp (staff may use cell phones on time off, but not down in the main camp area near campers).  You truly get to live in the outdoors and get-away from conventional life all summer long.</p>
          <p>There's lots of different types of activities at camp.  As said, you are outside pretty much all day except to sleep and eat.  There's a pool, horses, kayaks, climbing wall, zip line, rope challenge courses and many other fun activities such as capture the flag and archery.  Oh there is an arts and crafts hut, so there's one activity you do inside.  Before each meal the whole camp gathers to sing silly songs and cabin unit chants to show cabin unit pride.  There are plenty of "campfires" in the evenings, which pretty much means skit time and more singing!</p>

          <h2>Orcas Island Info</h2>
          <p>Orcas Island is located in the San Juan Islands of Washington State.  You must take the Washington State Ferry to the island from Anacortes, WA.  The population is only about 4,500 people so there is a small friendly community feel here.  During the summer it is busier as it is a very popular tourist area.  The main town on the island is Eastsound which is only about a mile and a half from camp, so you can drive or walk into town on time or days off.  There is a large state park called Moran State Park on the east side of the island with lots of camp sites.  It is a popluar area for counselors to go spend nights off from camp or even just the day time as there is a nice lake there to swim and hang out.  Mt. Constitution is located in Moran State Park as well which offers a hard but rewarding hike, or you can drive to top and take in the beautiful view.  Mt. Constitution is the tallest point in the San Juans, on a clear day you can see far and wide.  The weather on Orcas Island is mild during the summer, not too cold or too hot, typically in the low 60s-low 70s.  Mornings tend to be overcast but it usually burns off by lunchtime.</p>
